# OCR-Word-Detection (Image Processing)
This project focuses on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and extract words from images using Python, EasyOCR, PyTorch, and OpenCV (cv2). This OCR system leverages advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately identify and convert text within various images into editable and searchable data formats.

Features
* Detects and extracts words from images
* Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
* Utilizes EasyOCR and PyTorch for high accuracy
* Employs OpenCV (cv2) for image processing
* Easy-to-use interface for uploading and processing images
